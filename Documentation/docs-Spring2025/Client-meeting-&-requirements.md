#### **Project Goals**

- **What are the key objectives for improving the website?**

  - Ezirela: UI is a main focus, make the UI more cohesive and easier on the eyes. Backend changes; a portal tracking the judges so the officers know who they are, a spot for statistics of the members when they submit their application (major, age, food allergies) visible to admin portal. Admin tools; create category field that admins can add categories to that end users will see. Remove pictures from the home page possibly, replace with more informative information (https://hacklytics.io/#about)

  - Mysticrae: Site is limited to only people with a GGC address that is ACTIVE, alumni email are unable to access the site though/sign up. There is possibly a .edu filter that prevents non .edu emails from signing up. Submit a project; the form needs more fields (Category the project is being submitted for). Add school website to footer of the main page. A tool that may translate the entire website to Spanish for the hispanic event (low priority).

  - Shianne: Clean up blog home, style more. https://grizzly-hacks.web.app/blogHome. Turn the blog page into something more organized with "cards". Make mobile UI more organized and cleaner.

  - Leo: Using UI kits in order to make the site better.
