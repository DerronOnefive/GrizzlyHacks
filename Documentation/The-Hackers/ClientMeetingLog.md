# Client Meeting Log

**Grizzly Hacks App**

The Hackers

(Szavior McRae, Justin Sandman, Riley Housden, and Jordan Moats)

### Meeting #1 (2/3/2023):

- The main overview of the meeting was the fact that the layout of the site was already solid and our group was mainly meant to build upon the set foundations
- The Client started mentioning the removal of any copyrighted content present on the site currently
  - There is content from the Cartoon Network show "We Bare Bears" that would need to be removed before the site can be used officially
- Within the admin page regarding roles for users currently, there are only administrators and regular users with admins having access to pages to manage the various users, the client wants this adjusted to include a super admin role that can manage the admin users
- Looking over the code it is apparent that many of the technologies are still on versions prior to 2020 as a result the client wants this updated to their latest stable versions while maintaining current or better stability
  - This would include updating Angular, Bootstrap, NodeJS, and Firebase
- It was also mentioned to improve the documentation to ensure that the Grizzly Hacks Organization would be able to easily assimilate the website into their activities
- This led us to look at other colleges' hackathon websites and what could possibly be implemented from that feature-wise
  - The idea of a Grizzly Hacks Organization-focused section of the site that focuses on information about the general RSO rather than a specific hackathon
- We were reminded that anything added should still maintain the general color scheme present of the club logo and GGC as a whole
- After the voice meeting, we followed up to clarify some information regarding security, performance, and general visual aspects
  - It was mentioned since the repository is public that any keys to the database should be hidden to ensure user information safety
  - Other users besides the admins should not have access to each other's information if not intended
  - Maintain the security standards set up for user creation regarding password selection following stricter guidelines
  - Maintain the current performance of the site if not improve upon it
    - This may correlate with migrating to new versions of the technology
