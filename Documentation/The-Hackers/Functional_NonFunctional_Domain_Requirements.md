# Requirements

**Grizzly Hacks App**

The Hackers

(Szavior McRae, Justin Sandman, Riley Housden, and Jordan Moats)

### Functional Requirements:

| Description | Priority | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
|1. Update the Technologies used to construct the site to their latest stable versions (Angular, Bootstrap, NodeJS, and Firebase)|High |Due to the app originally being made in 2020 there is a major difference in the version used then and the latest stable releases. This also means many methods of doing things have been improved upon in newer versions that could lead to better security, performance, and stability. |
|2. Implement hierarchy amongst user accounts introducing a higher level role than just admin that can manage which users are admins (Super Admin Role)|High | Currently within the user account management system there are admins and users. This isn't optimal as not all leadership members within the Grizzly Hacks Organization may need the same capabilities when it comes to managing accounts. |
|3. Create a section of the App focused on the information regarding the Grizzly Hacks Organization| Medium | In a similar vein to other Hackathon Organizations at other Colleges they typically spread information about the managing organization as well. This could lead to people viewing the site being pushed towards joining Grizzly Hacks. |

### Non-Functional Requirements:

| Description | Priority | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
|1. Maintain the current level of Security and Performance on the site| High | Due to this site holding a large amount of data from unaffiliated users it is imperative that this data is secure and only accessible by intended parties. It may also be accessed by large amounts of users so performance is imperative |
|2. Maintain a level of professionalism and consistency within any content present on the site| Medium | Due to this being an Organization affiliated with GGC there is a certain level of professionalism that is expected among anything representing them. Also, colors should be consistent among various app elements |

### Domain Requirements:

| Description | Priority | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
|1. Clean up the documentation and underlying code to be ready to transfer to the Grizzly Hacks Organization for official use | Medium | The current version while documented is not very developer friendly for picking up and immediately running, therefore, it would help to clean up the code to make readability easier. |
